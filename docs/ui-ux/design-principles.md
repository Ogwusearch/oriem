This document outlines the design principles that guide the user interface and user experience of the ORiem Finance platform. These principles ensure a consistent, accessible, and delightful experience across all user touchpoints.

## 🎯 1. Clarity Over Complexity

- Prioritize **clear labels**, **intuitive layouts**, and **progressive disclosure**.
- Avoid clutter. Each screen should focus on a single primary goal.
- Example: Use tabs and collapsible panels instead of long, scrolling pages.

---

## ⚖️ 2. Consistency Across the App

- Use a shared **component library** and **design tokens** (colors, spacing, typography).
- Maintain consistent **iconography**, **button styles**, and **form controls**.
- All UI elements should behave predictably across pages and platforms.

---

## 📱 3. Mobile-First Responsiveness

- Design for **small screens first**, then scale up.
- All components must be **touch-friendly**, with sufficient padding and readable font sizes.
- Support breakpoints: `mobile`, `tablet`, `desktop`.

---

## 🌐 4. Accessibility Is Mandatory

- Meet **WCAG 2.1** standards.
- Use semantic HTML, proper ARIA labels, and sufficient contrast ratios.
- All components should be **keyboard navigable** and screen-reader friendly.

---

## ⏱ 5. Speed & Performance

- Prioritize **fast-loading interfaces** with minimal blocking assets.
- Use **loading indicators** and **lazy loading** where appropriate.
- Keep animations under **300ms** for a snappy feel.

---

## 🔐 6. Trust & Security Cues

- Always show confirmation for financial actions (e.g., transfers, withdrawals).
- Display **status indicators** and **verified badges** for secure actions.
- Use clear error states and feedback (e.g., red for errors, green for success).

---

## 👁 7. Visual Hierarchy

- Use **font size**, **weight**, and **color** to guide user attention.
- Layout content with a strong **Z-pattern** or **F-pattern** where appropriate.
- Leverage white space to group related items and increase scanability.

---

## 🧭 8. User Control & Feedback

- Offer **undo options** and non-destructive actions where possible.
- Use modals/dialogs sparingly and only when full user attention is required.
- Provide **real-time validation** and immediate feedback on actions.

---

## 🔁 9. Iterative Improvement

- Regularly conduct **usability testing** and **user feedback sessions**.
- Track usage analytics to find friction points.
- Adapt designs based on real-world behavior, not just assumptions.

---

## ✅ 10. Human-Centered Design

- Think in terms of user **needs**, **goals**, and **emotions**.
- Simplify financial tasks through helpful copy and visual aids.
